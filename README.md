Mo's React Redux Boilerplate using Higher Order Functions and Decorators

A cool starting point for my React based Projects that will use Redux Middleware, Higher Order Functions and Decorators.

This repo is built on react-webpack-starter by @bradtraversy - Thanks brad! Great Repo.

Continuously being worked upon - create and issue if you want to see new stuff or run a pull request with any cool stuff you have done.

PS. Keep in my this repo is mainly aimed at having a starting point for those greenfield projects using react. 

We want to create a few versions of this repo each with the following possible features :

- Routes : Private and Public Routes
- Authentication for Private routes
- Crud functions for API endpoints
- Add Material UI for React
- React Native equivalent 

Best,
Mo
